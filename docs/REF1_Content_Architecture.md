# Content Architecture

## Model First Principle
When building new feature, always design JCR content structure first, reading/writing using Sling servlet later

## Everything is content

## ID's evil

## References are considered as harmful

## Drive the content hierarchy, donâ€™t let it happen

## Workspaces are for clone(), merge() and update()
